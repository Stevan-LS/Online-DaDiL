# Integral Probability Metrics module

In this module, we implement the following IPMs,

- ```ot_ipms.py```: IPMs based on Optimal Transport.
- ```mmd_ipms.py```: IPMs based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy

Currently Implemented IPMs,

- [x] Wasserstein distance
- [x] Joint Wasserstein distance
- [x] Class-Condtional Wasserstein distance
- [x] MMD
- [x] Class-Condtional MMD
